# AI-Backend Labs 🧪

**The Implementation Layer.** This repository is the practical side of my [foundations](https://github.com/yunqiji-dev/foundations) brain.  
It’s a lab for building **reliable systems** while exploring how **AI can assist** the engineering process.

> Build systems, understand how they work, and use AI to help.

## 🏷️ Why "AI-Backend Labs"?

The name explains my approach to modern engineering:

- **AI**: Using intelligent tools to work faster and solve problems more effectively.  
- **Backend**: The core focus—building the invisible **infrastructure** and **logic** that must remain stable and fast.  
- **Labs**: A place to experiment. This is where theory from `foundations` meets running code.

## 🏛️ Pillars (01–03)

The lab is divided into three areas that I am actively exploring.  
Each lab links back to a concept in `foundations`.

- **[01-foundational-courses](./01-foundational-courses)** | **Solid Foundations** Practicing the basics from world-class courses. If the foundation is weak, the system will fail.

- **[02-backend-development](./02-backend-development)** | **Backend Systems** Learning to build **server-side services**, manage data, and ensure system reliability. The goal is stability and performance.

- **[03-ai-implementations](./03-ai-implementations)** | **AI Integration** Exploring how to add "smart" features to projects and how to use AI to improve my own coding workflow.

## 🛠️ Guidelines

1. **Foundations Link**: Whether it's a simple script or a complex service, every lab should help internalize a concept from `foundations`.
2. **Code Over Scripts**: Even in basic exercises (like CS50P), focus on writing clean, readable, and structured code.
3. **Keep it Flat**: Use short folder names and maintain a flat structure to keep the repository scannable.
4. **Progress over Perfection**: Don't over-engineer simple tasks. The goal is to prove the logic, then move forward.

## 🧠 Philosophy

**"I don't need to know everything today, but I will implement everything I learn."**

Theory without practice is incomplete; practice without theory is risky. This lab is where I bridge that gap, one experiment at a time.
